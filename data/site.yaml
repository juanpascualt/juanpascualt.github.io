      This paper examines the impact of an innovative firm-based vocational training program (DVT) on youth crime rates in Catalonia. Exploiting the staggered geographical implementation of DVT, which emphasizes extensive on-the-job training in companies relative to regular school-based vocational training, we use a Difference-in-Differences approach to estimate causal effects. Leveraging detailed administrative education and geolocated crime data, our analysis reveals that increased availability of firm-based vocational training significantly reduces local youth crime rates. The findings highlight the potential of high-quality vocational education as a crucial policy intervention for crime prevention.

      Barcelona’s 2019 admission quotas reserve seats for socioeconomically vulnerable students in each public and charter school. I estimate impacts on school segregation, parental applications, and achievement–parental education gradients using difference in differences and a structural model of school and neighborhood choice. Preliminary results show sizable reductions in segregation as schools converge to quota targets, but higher vulnerable student shares lead to fewer applications.
